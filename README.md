To play the game: 
Ensure that the 'resources' folder with the required audio files is in the same directory as your main.py script.
Also double-check the working directory or the location from which you are running the executable. Ensure it is the directory containing the script and the 'resources' folder.
Enjoy!ðŸ˜Ž
